Hi! My name is Caitlin M. Allen and I am a threat analyst at a security company in Vermont. I graduated in May of 2021 with my Bachelor's in Computer Networking & Cybersecurity with a minor in Computer & Digital Forensics. While at Champlain, I was the Communications Lead for Womxn in Technology and a member of Cybersecurity Club and Digital Forensics Assocition.\
My interest in threat intelligence began when I was an intern at my current company when I would help the forming threat intelligence team with OSINT and shadow their work. Since beginning my career in intelligence, I've loved getting to threat hunt, create visualizations and statistics in Splunk to present findings, and continuing to help mature our new intelligence program.\
While I absolutely love the world of cybersecurity, I also am an avid dressage rider who took time off from competing to complete my undergrad. Throughout high school, I was a competiting member of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF), United States Dressage Federation (USDF), and Eastern States Dressage and Combined Training Association (ESDCTA). I even was a varsity equestrian athlete through the USEF and the first varsity equestrian at my high school! I'm now currently riding again and hoping to eventually jump back into the world of competing.\
I hope to share my knowledge and learn more on my own by writing up some posts!
